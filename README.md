Introduction
ReactJS has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). System design for ReactJS involves structuring your app to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. This repository provides insights and guidelines for designing ReactJS applications with these goals in mind.

ReactJS Architecture Overview
React follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build applications by composing reusable UI elements. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the key architectural aspects of a React application:

Component-Based Architecture: React apps are built by combining components that represent different parts of the UI. Components can be reusable and stateful or stateless.

Unidirectional Data Flow: Data in React flows in one direction, from parent to child components. This makes it easier to manage state and understand how data changes in an application.

JSX Syntax: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows HTML to be written within JavaScript code, providing an easier and more intuitive way to define UI components.
